This project started as a chat application tutorial from the GreatStack YouTube channel. I used it as a base to learn, and then gradually upgraded it with my own ideas and features.

The app is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled using Tailwind CSS.

🔥 Features I Added on Top of the Tutorial

😁 Emojis – send fun emojis in chats

✅ Real-time ticks – see when a message is sent and delivered

📅 Date-wise separation of chats – conversations are grouped and labeled by date

🗓 Chatting dates display – shows when you had the conversation for better context

🌟 Core Features (from the base project + my tweaks)

🔐 Secure login & authentication

👤 User profiles with avatars and bio

💬 One-to-one text and image messaging

🔔 Instant feedback with toast notifications

🎨 Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind

✨ For me, this project was both a learning journey and a way to explore how real-world chat apps are built. Starting from a tutorial gave me the foundation, and adding custom features made it my own.

I’ll keep improving it — and I’d love suggestions or feedback from others! 🚀
